## About the project!
I wanted to create a portfolio that was modern, easy to update, and straightforward to deploy. Instead of keeping it to myself, I decided to make it open-source. My hope is that it can serve as a useful starting point for others looking to build their own online presence.

Feel free to use it as-is, or fork it and make it your own. If you find it helpful, I'd love to see what you build with it

## Built with
This portfolio is built with the following technologies:
- Next.js
- A few other awesome libraries
