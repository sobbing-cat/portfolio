## About the Project

I wanted to create a portfolio that was modern, easy to update, and straightforward to deploy. Instead of keeping it to myself, I decided to make it open-source. My hope is that it can serve as a useful starting point for others looking to build their own online presence.

Feel free to use it as-is, or fork it and make it your own. If you find it helpful, I'd love to see what you build with it!

## Showcase

Here are some of the portfolios and websites built with this template:

If you've built something using this project, please let me know! Contact me via email at [sobbingcat@kukiku.org](sobbingcat@kukiku.org), and I'll be happy to add your site to the list.

## Getting Started

I have designed this project to be as easy to use as possible. For a basic setup, you only need to edit your personal details.

**1. Edit Your Content**
Simply go into the `content` folder and change the files in there. You don't need to touch any code for this!

**2. Advanced Customization**
For more significant changes, you will need to edit the source code. This is necessary if you want to modify the layout, change the styles, or translate the user interface.

Please note there is no built-in support for multiple languages. If you want to change static UI text (like navigation links "Home", "About", or page titles) to another language, you will have to edit these values directly in the code yourself.

## Built With

This portfolio is built with the following technologies:

* Next.js
* Tailwind
* Shadcn UI
    * For convenience, every component available from Shadcn UI at the time of this project's creation has already been added. While not all are used in the default template, they are available for you to implement without needing to add them manually.
* Tabler Icons
* A few other awesome libraries
